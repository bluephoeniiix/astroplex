## AstroPlex

The reason I named this CMS "AstroPlex" is that it is a modified version of [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/)  and uses IBM Plex as the base font.

To the typography, I made many minor layout modifications from [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/).
