## Inspired By IBM Carbon Design

Two months before prototyping this site, I was searching through almost all available CMS frameworks, and I found [Carbon Theme Gatsby](https://gatsby.carbondesignsystem.com/). I suddenly became attracted to its unique colors and typography. However, this project is no longer maintained by IBM and has been transferred to the community.

Then I had a decent try on this framework, I found that:

1. **Disadvantages:**
   - No dark theme support
   - No support for math formulas
   - Each run takes forever and burns out CPU
   - Fewer customizations
   - Outdated npm packages

2. **Advantages:**
   - IBM-style design
   - Full functionality for technical instruction documentation

3. **Widely used by IBM but not on every important site**

The last one is an important point. Many "not that important" IBM software documents are purely constructed by this framework. Even though the Carbon team has given up on maintaining it, they still use it. When you look at those websites, you may find the "Edit Link" pointed to a GitHub repo. All of those projects are written in the `mdx` language for the most part, and they all look exactly the same.


## Reasons Switch To Astro & Future Plan

I don't want my website to be a copied and pasted product from [Carbon Theme Gatsby](https://gatsby.carbondesignsystem.com/), though I **really** like those IBM typographies. To be honest, IBM masters typography much better than Apple.

Except for those pages quickly generated by [Carbon Theme Gatsby](https://gatsby.carbondesignsystem.com/), IBM uses purely React webpages (on Carbon's stylesheet) on their very important pages. Unfortunately, none of them are open-sourced for me to copy.

That's the reason I switched to Astro. I tried to imitate IBM styles as much as I can, but that is quite beyond my level. So, if you are interested in what I said, feel free to take over this project, and I'll appreciate it.
